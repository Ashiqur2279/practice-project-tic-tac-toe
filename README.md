  <h1>Tic Tac Toe: A Fun Twist on a Classic</h1>

  <p>Hey there! I built this Tic Tac Toe game to bring a touch of nostalgia and strategy to your fingertips.</p>

  <h2>What's Inside:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Clean Interface: A smooth and visually appealing board for a seamless experience.</li>
    <li>Pick Your Weapon: Choose your marker (X or O) and dive in.</li>
    <li>Turn Tracking: The game keeps track of your moves, ensuring a fair battle.</li>
    <li>Winning Logic: Smart detection of winning lines, so you know when you've conquered the board.</li>
    <li>Tie Handling: The game recognizes a draw (all squares filled) and prompts you to start fresh.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Play:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Go the link : <a href="https://project-tic-tac-toe-by-ashiqur2279.netlify.app/">Project Tic-Tac-Toe</a></li>
    <li>Choose your marker.</li>
    <li>Click on empty squares to make your moves.</li>
    <li>Be the first to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of your marker to claim victory!</li>
    <li>If all squares fill up, it's a tie â€“ click the reset button for another round.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Future Ideas:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>AI opponent for single-player challenges</li>
    <li>Multiplayer mode for head-to-head battles</li>
    <li>Difficulty levels to test your strategic skills</li>
    <li>Customization options for board themes or marker styles</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This project is a testament to my development skills and my passion for creating engaging experiences. Feel free to tinker, challenge your friends, and have some fun!</p>
